# Smart-Agriculture-Based-on-IOT-and-AI
The Automatic Irrigation System aims to optimize water usage in agriculture by using sensors to monitor soil moisture, water levels, temperature, and humidity. Controlled by an Arduino Uno, the system activates a DC pump only when necessary, conserving water and preventing damage. Real-time data is uploaded to an Adafruit IoT dashboard via NodeMCU
